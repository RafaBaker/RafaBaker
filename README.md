## Hi there, I am Rafael Rodrigues ðŸ‘‹

I am a former student of IFES-Serra (Instituto Federal do EspÃ­rito Santo) as a Computer Technician. Currently I am on the fourth period of Computer Science at UFES (Universidade Federal do EspÃ­rito Santo).

Over my journey I have learned many programming languages as Python, Java, JS, C, PHP, etc. As a developer I want to improve my skills of solving problems and being able to use as many technologies as I can. This is the reason that I am going into Web3.

My goals on Web3 are to expand my knowledge in a brand new area for me and that fascinantes me a lot. The idea of a descrentralized world walks side by side with how I see the world, so the Web3 for me is more than trying to "make money".
