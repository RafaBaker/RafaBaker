## Hi there, I am Rafael Rodrigues ðŸ‘‹

I am a former student of IFES-Serra (Instituto Federal do EspÃ­rito Santo) as a Computer Technician. Currently I am on the fourth semester of Computer Science at UFES (Universidade Federal do EspÃ­rito Santo).

Throughout my journey, I have learned many programming languages, such as Python, Java, JS, C, and PHP. As a developer, I am driven to constantly improve my problem-solving skills and master as many technologies as I can. This passion for learning is precisely what led me to dive into Web3.

My goal in the Web3 space is to expand my knowledge in this field that I find incredibly fascinating. The concept of a decentralized world aligns perfectly with my personal worldview, so for me, Web3 is about much more than financial opportunitiesâ€”it's about building a more transparent and equitable future.

I am at the very beginning of my Web3 journey and I'm incredibly excited about the possibilities. I'm eager to learn, collaborate on innovative projects, and connect with others who are passionate about building the next generation of the internet.
